Application Requirements
You need to build a UI using ReactJS, which looks as shown in the below image. More flags are visible upon scrolling down.

Make use of the following API endpoint to fetch the countries’ data: https://xcountries-backend.labs.crio.do/all

Make sure you follow the good practice of using the **alt ** attribute for each country flag’s img tag.

Display the country name along with the flag image as shown in the screenshot.

You must follow the good practice of doing error handling by catching the error and logging the error message on the console using console.error, while trying to fetch data from the mentioned API endpoint. Use the error message "Error fetching data: " followed by the error received.
